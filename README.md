# Fetch Exercise Starter (Static HTML/CSS/JS)

This repo is a partial solution to the in-class Fetch exercise from Week 7, based on the http-server starter template. This makes one fetch call to get categories and logs them to the console but doesn't  modify the page DOM or access individual categories via e.g. "?category=cooking" query string (TODO FOR STUDENTS)
